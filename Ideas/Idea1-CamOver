 What is CamOver?

CamOver is an open-source tool by EntySec, described as a “camera exploitation tool” that can extract/admin-login credentials from certain network-connected cameras. It targets typically network cameras (CCTV, IP cameras, etc.), especially models or firmware that store credentials or configuration in accessible files. 

The tool tries to access a camera’s internal config file — e.g. a path like /system.ini?loginuse&loginpas. If the camera exposes that file over HTTP (or a similar interface), CamOver reads it and extracts plaintext credentials (username/password). It works with many popular vulnerable camera brands/protocols, such as “CCTV, GoAhead, Netwave” as per its documentation. CamOver supports multiple modes: 
Exploit single camera by specifying its address. 
Exploit multiple cameras concurrently (via threading) by feeding it a list of addresses. 
Use public-exposure search engines (via APIs like Shodan or ZoomEye) to find potentially vulnerable cameras on the internet — then try to pull credentials from all found devices.

It provides both a command-line interface (CLI) and also exposes a Python API if we would want to use it programmatically in scripts.

What makes it work (and when it won’t work)

 It is predicated on the camera's firmware or web interface being improperly configured or insecure; more precisely, it assumes that the credential file (or a comparable configuration endpoint) is network-accessible and unrestricted by authentication.

 If the camera has up-to-date security (no exposed config files, proper authentication, firewall, etc.), CamOver will likely fail.  —  it depends on mis-configurations / vulnerabilities.

 Simply using CamOver won't reach the camera if it is protected by a network firewall, only accessible locally, or requires a VPN.

 Using Shodan or ZoomEye to locate cameras on the public Internet may yield a large number of random devices; the likelihood that a camera is truly vulnerable may be minimal.
